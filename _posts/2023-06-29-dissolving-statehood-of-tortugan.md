  value: The Governor of Tortugán has [declared
    independence](https://www.reddit.com/r/CivMC/comments/14lrvjz/independence_post_on_behalf_of_tortugan_leadership/).
    While this *does* technically violate Article 8 (b) of the Constitution, I
    believe it's understandable given the circumstances. In the interest of
    continuity, we should vote to dissolve the State of Tortugán pursuant to
    Article 8 (c).
changes:
  - target: statehood-for-tortugan
    kind: repeal
  - target: statute-of-territory
    kind: amendment
